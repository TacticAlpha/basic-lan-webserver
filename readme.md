## Warning
This is not at all secure and has no security features, don't use it on public networks or for anything other than 
testing or maybe personal use at home. You have been warned, I am not responsible for any damage that is incured while using 
this project or any fork of it

## Why?
I just made it for small lan projects/just messing around.
It only took me a few hours to make, knowing nothing about websockets before, but that's still time saved if someone uses this 
instead of taking time to make their own.
Also I'm new to webhooks so if you see an issue anywhere or something can be done better, don't hesitate to make a pull request!
